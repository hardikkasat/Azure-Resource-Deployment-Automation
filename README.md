# Azure-Resource-Deployment-Automation
The Azure Resource Deployment Automation project automates the creation of an Azure environment using Azure PowerShell. It includes creating a resource group, a virtual network (VNet) with subnets, and a Windows virtual machine (VM). The script also sets up auto-scaling for the VM based on CPU metrics and tags the resources for cost management and categorization. This project demonstrates proficiency in cloud automation, resource management, and Azure infrastructure setup.

Note: The script contains several editable fields, such as the resource group name, VM size, admin credentials, and location. These should be customized according to specific requirements before running the script.

Tech Used: PowerShell for automation scripting, Azure PowerShell Module for managing Azure resources, Azure VMs, VNets, and Resource Groups for cloud infrastructure, Auto-scaling and Tagging for optimization and cost control
